    <h2>The Beast of No Nation by XYZ
<h3>Rationale:</h3>
<p>The movie is a depiction of the true implications of bad governance in the African countries;<br/>Thus resulted to revolution and distruction of lifes and properties.</p>

    <h2>Hotel Rewanda by XYZ</h2>
<h3>Rationale:</h3>
<p>The impact of dispartiy and inequality between the Utu and Tutsi led to the perception of one claiming majority to other minority; <br /> This led to the killings of thousands of lifes and distruction of properties;<br /> The implication to African leaders and the colonial masters suggests the importance of fostering equality between ethnic groups in a country.

    <h2>The Hacksaw Ridge by XYZ</h2>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>My love for this movie is something out of this world; <br /> It shows that one can accomplish all things through a supernatural enpowerment.
